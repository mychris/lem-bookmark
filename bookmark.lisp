      "Bookmarks for the lem editor.
Bookmarks are paths to files or directories that make it easy to open them.  Each
bookmark has a name, and can have a position assotiated with it.

The command BOOKMARK-SET is used to create a new bookmark, which points to the file
of the current buffer and the current cursor position.  The name of the bookmark will be 
prompted for.  If you wish to not associate a position with the bookmark, you can use
BOOKMARK-SET-NO-POSITION.  This might be useful, if another package is managing file
positions for you.

To open a previously set bookmark, use BOOKMARK-JUMP.

The set bookmarks are not persisted automatically.  The commands BOOKMARK-SAVE and
BOOKMARK-LOAD are used to save and load the bookmarks from disk.  The variable
*FILE* configures from which file the bookmark information is read from/saved to.

The keymap *KEYMAP* has some pre-defined mappings for most of the available commands.

Use (DESCRIBE (FIND-PACKAGE \"BOOKMARK\")) to find all available commands.")
